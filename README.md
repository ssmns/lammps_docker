LAMMPS is a classical molecular dynamics simulation code designed to
run efficiently on parallel computers.  It was developed at Sandia
National Laboratories, a US Department of Energy facility, with
funding from the DOE.  It is an open-source code, distributed freely
under the terms of the GNU Public License (GPL).

this repository contain a DockerFile to compile and instal lammps on your machine. 
we hope this DockerFile be useful for your simulation. 
some package ( gpu / kokkos) need to compile and in future we add this package to lammps.
